# Lemma X

This is a computer proof of a multigraph lemma used in the paper entitled Every 3-connected {K_{1,3}, \Gamma_3}-free graph is Hamilton-connected.
See Description_of_algorithm.pdf for details.

## Usage

run main.py

The agorithm generates:
- the list of all multigraphs which satisfy the conditions of the lemma
- plaintext full proof of the lemma 

## Prerequisites

I use:
- Python 3.10.9 
- SageMath 9.6

The code should work with some older versions as well.
